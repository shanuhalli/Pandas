# Pandas

Pandas is one of the most popular Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas provide useful functions to manipulate large amount of structured data. Pandas provide easiest method to perform analysis. It provides large data structure and manipulating numerical tables and time series data. Pandas is a perfect tool for data wrangling. Pandas is designed for quick and easy data manipulation, aggregation, and visualization. There two data structures in Pandas – 

Series: It Handle and store data in One-dimensional data.

DataFrame: It Handle and store Two-dimensional data. You can load your data into data frames, you can select columns, filter for specific values, group by values, run functions (sum, mean, median, min, max, etc.), merge dataframes and so on. You can also create multi-dimensional data-tables.

Pandas is not a predictive analytics or machine learning library. It was created for data analysis, data cleaning, data handling and data discovery… By the way, these are the necessary steps before you run machine learning projects, and that’s why you will need pandas for every scientific project too.
